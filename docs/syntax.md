## Comments

```hs
-- You can write a comment by
-- typing two dashes (--) followed
-- by any character, up until a newline.
```

Comments are legal anywhere whitespace is allowed, meaning pretty much anywhere.

There are no multiline comments.

## Literals

A `literal` is a lexeme that represents a value _literally_. Below are all possible literal productions, ordered by simplicity.

### Booleans

Odd features two values that represent truth and falsehood: `true` and `false`, respectively.

```hs
infinity > 1 -- true
1 == ''1''-- false
```

### Nothing

It's really useful to be able to say something holds no value, instead of crashing and burning. There's a special literal for this case: `nothing`. It behaves like `null` does in other c-like languages.

Nothing is equal to `nothing`, except itself:

```hs
nothing == nothing -- true
1 == nothing -- false
```

### Numbers

A number is any string of consecutive digits:

```hs
1;
10;
123456789;
```

#### Legibility

To increase the legibility of a number, you can insert a _comma_ (`,`) anywhere between digits:

```hs
1000000;
-- is the same as
1,000,000;
```

#### Decimal

Decimal numerals are denoted with a _full stop_ (`.`) to separate the integral and decimal parts:

```hs
1.5;
372.8738;
```

The integral part is optional:

```hs
0.123456789;
-- is the same as
.123456789;
```

You cannot insert commas after the full stop:

```hs
1,000.03534 -- ok!
1.033,534 -- ERROR!
```

#### Exponent

A number can contain an exponent, delimited by _the letter e_ (case-insensitive):

```hs
1e6;
-- is the same as
1E6;
-- is the same as
1,000,000;
```

The exponent is assumed to be positive, but can be explicitly marked as such:

```hs
1e6;
-- is the same as
1e+6;
```

The exponent can also be negative:

```hs
1e-6;
-- is the same as
0.000001;
-- is the same as
.000001;
```

#### Infinity

There is a special literal in Odd that represents a number greater than any other number, named `infinity`. This is also the case for `-infinity`, which is always smaller than any other number.

Of course, infinity isn't a number but let's pretend üòâ.

<br/>

### Strings

A string is a sequence of any character (except newlines), contained within _two single apostrophes_ (`''`):

```hs
''This is a string!'';
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Multiline strings are a planned feature, and will use the same syntax.

#### Interpolation

> TODO

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è String interpolation is a planned feature. It will use the backslash (`\`) to denote interpolated parts.

#### Common pitfalls in strings

The reason Odd uses this syntax is to avoid common pitfalls of strings in other languages.

Strings often contain quotes themselves, requiring multiple string delimiters, or escaping mechanisms:

```js
// JavaScript
"Daniel's dog is named \"Bert\"";
'Daniel\'s dog is named "Bert"';
```

In Odd, you don't have to escape any quote, nor do you need to switch delimiters to fit your needs:

```hs
''Daniel's dog is named "Bert"'';
```

The reason we chose to use double apostrophes, is because they are available and easily typeable for most people around the world, unlike alternatives such as the _backtick_ (`` ` ``).

<br/>

### Names

A _name_ ‚Äî often called an _identifier_ in other languages ‚Äî is _a case-insensitive sequence of any letter and number, beginning with a letter:_

```hs
name;
name2;
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è For those who can read it, it's recognised with the following regex:
>
> ```
> /[a-z]+\w*(?:-\w+)*/i
> ```

To separate words within a name, you can use _hyphens_ (`-`):

```hs
this-is-also-a-name;
```

The way we separate words in a name is often called _kebab case_, because of the resemblance to kebab on a skewer.

Odd supports kebab case because it's more legible than _camelCase_ or _PascalCase_, and requires fewer key presses than _snake_case_. While camelCasing your variables is still possible, the official Odd styleguide requires kebab-case.

#### Common pitfalls in names

Because the hyphen character is also used for the minus operator, one might get confused between `a-name` and `an - expression`. In practise, people mostly put spaces between terms and operators in their maths, so it's easily distinguishable.

This requirement does prevent some code minification, but it's not desirable to send source files over the wire; compiled programs are preferred.

<br/>

### Lists

In Odd, you can group several values into a single value by wrapping it in a _list_. A list consists of _an opening square bracket (`[`), followed by zero or more expressions delimited by a comma (`,`), followed by a closing square bracket (`]`)_:

```hs
[]; -- empty list

[this, is, a, list, of, names];

[ any-value-is-allowed,
  3456,
  10 * .3,
  ''string'',
  x -> y,
  [ lists-in-lists,
    are-also-allowed ] ];
```

A list can contain a _dangling comma_.

To merge two lists _literally_, you can destructure them:

```hs
-- given two lists
a = [1,2,3];
b = [4,5,6];

-- the destructuring
[ ...a,
  ...b ]

-- is equal to
[1,2,3,4,5,6];
```

<br/>

### Records

In Odd, you can categorise several values into a single value by wrapping it in a _record_. A record consists of _an opening accolade (`{`), followed by zero or more fields delimited by a comma (`,`), followed by a closing accolade (`}`)_.

Fields are optional:

```hs
{}; -- empty record
```

Fields have several forms. A field can be named with a `name`, followed by an equals sign (`=`) and then an expression:

```hs
{ name = value,
  another-name = another-value };
```

A record can contain a _dangling comma_:

```hs
{
  a = b,
  c = d, -- <-
};
```

A field can also be a function:

```hs
{ mult a b = a * b };
```

If there exists a variable `var` in the current scope, a record can be assigned a field with the name `var` and the value of `var`:

```hs
{ var };
-- is the same as
{ var = var };
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Dynamic field names are a planned feature, which will use the string syntax.

To merge two records _literally_, you can destructure them:

```hs
-- given two records
x = {
  a = 1,
  b = 2,
  c = 3 };
y = {
  d = 4,
  e = 5,
  f = 6 };

-- the destructuring
{ ...x,
  ...y }

-- is equal to
{ a = 1,
  b = 2,
  c = 3,
  d = 4,
  e = 5,
  f = 6 };
```

<br/>

### Operators

Most non-letter characters are treated as operators. Multiple non-letter characters in a row are recognised as one operator:

```hs
multiply = (*);
divide = (/);
fish = (><>);
brainfuck = (+<>-+>-);
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è For those who can read it, operators are recognised with the following regex:
>
> ```
> /[-!@#$%^&*_+=:\|\/\\\.\<\>\?]+/
> ```
>
> _Operators such as `->` and `=` are special and cannot be overwritten._

The Odd prelude defines often-used operators in global scope.

An operator is placed between two expressions:

```hs
a + b;
```

Operators are values (they are just functions), so they can also be used in application:

```hs
(*) 3 3;
-- is the same as
3 * 3;
```

An operator literal requires parentheses (`()`) around it if not in infix notation.

[They can be used in assignments too](#assignment), which we will expand upon later.

<br/>

### Lambdas

In Odd you can write nameless functions that are values themselves. These are often called _lambdas_, because the idea stems from [the lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus), which denotes functions with the lambda character (`Œª`).

Lambdas in Odd are denoted by an arrow (`->`) between parameters and body:

```hs
param -> body;
```

Functions can have multiple parameters, and so can lambdas:

```hs
a b c -> a - b + c;
```

To prevent the parser getting confused over which values are parameters in an application, you can use parentheses:

```hs
-- A lambda with two parameters `a` and `b`
a b -> c;

-- Application of `a` to `b -> c`
a (b -> c);
```

<br/>

## Assignment

You can assign a value to a name using the _equals sign_ (`=`):

```hs
a = b;
```

Odd values are immutable:

```hs
a = b;
a = c; -- ERROR! Can't redeclare `a`.
```

A function can be declared with the same syntax:

```hs
multiply a b = a * b;
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è [We will expand upon function syntax later on](#application).

<br/>
<br/>

## Application

Function application in Odd is done by _juxtaposition_:

```hs
f x;
```

This syntax allows for more natural notation of data transformation.

This differs from many C-like languages and math notation:

```js
f(x);
```

One could think of these syntaxes as the same, but without requiring parentheses (the c-like syntax is also legal syntax in Odd).

## Modules

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Modules are a planned feature after asynchronicity is thought out. When implemented they will behave like records.

<br/>
<br/>

## Functions

> TODO

<br/>
<br/>

## Types

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Types are a planned feature. Odd will feature a strict HM type system. Any value will be soundly typed, but type syntax should stay out of the programmer's way.
