## Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the Odd language, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a reaction can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter. If an Issue describes any problems you are having _exactly_, please consider reacting with üëç instead of posting a comment.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any files for local development aren't pushed onto your branch. If new files are generated as a result of your changes, add them to the `.gitignore`.
2. Update the corresponding documentation files ([README](./README.md), [docs](./docs/syntax.md), etc) with information regarding your changes.
3. Increase the version numbers in the necessary files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
