# Odd Language

_Hmm, that's **odd**..._

## üß† Philosophy

Odd is highly W.I.P. but these are the main goals of the language:

- Odd must have functional, expressive and flowing syntax.
  - Programming "patterns" are often a sign of lacking expressiveness within a language. We like a solid language over SOLID principles.
  - Programs are read far more often than they are written. Odd should contain little to no weird jumps in program flow for readers to trip over.
- Odd must have no (unnecessary) dependencies.
  - It's fine to call it _"reinventing the wheel"_, but in reality Odd doesn't need [an ASCII art of Guy fiery in some dependency's dependency](https://medium.com/s/silicon-satire/i-peeked-into-my-node-modules-directory-and-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next-b89f63d21558), or any other useless import for that fact.
- Odd must run on every machine (_within reason, of course_).
  - A tiny footprint should allow the language to be used and embedded anywhere. Imagine your IOT devices running Odd ü§Ø.
  - Having an old(er) or less powerful device should never be a reason to be unable to program.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

> Odd is guaranteed to work with node version 16.13.1, but should be compatible with earlier versions down to v12, possibly requiring the `--harmony` flag.

To try the Odd REPL for a spin, download the repo and run it through Node:

```shell
tsc # compile source
node dist/repl.js # run repl
```

To try the Odd interpreter, download the repo and run it through Node:

```shell
tsc # compile source
node dist/interpreter.js path/to/file.odd # run interpreter on path/to/file.odd
```

When Odd is finished, it will be a standalone executable requiring no separate Node installation, or any other dependency.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Some work has yet to be done for odd to release as v1.0. The following is a list of development milestones to get to **v1.0**:

- [ ] ‚è±Ô∏è **0.1**: REPL Parser and interpreter.
- [ ] ‚è±Ô∏è **0.2**: HM structured typing.
- [ ] ‚è±Ô∏è **0.3**: Module system.
- [ ] ‚è±Ô∏è **0.4**: First compilation target (probably typescript).
- [ ] üèÅ **1.0**: VSCode Language Server
